# Splunk Gaming Labs (SGL)

SGL is a project for gamers to collabroate on getting data into [Splunk](http://splunk.com).

# Why do this thing?

Games are cool. Big data is cool. Why not combine the two things into one? If you need more of an incentive than that, then how about these:
* Learn Splunk: it's always easier to learn something in your spare time if you have an fun excuse to really dig in
* Analzye game perforamce: analyzing your in-game performance over time can lead to better gaming
* Bragging rights: Got a sweet K/D ratio? Finsihed a campagin in record time? Now you have proof!

# How can I help?

Submit pull requests! Edit this readme. Open issues to track games you are working on. Create wiki pages to document research on how to get data from games. Getting Data In (GDI) can be a challenge for COTS software.
